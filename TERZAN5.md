## What makes this system interesting?

Terzan 5 is a complex globular cluster (GC)-like system located in the bulge of the Milky Way galaxy.  It's complex due to its spread in stellar ages and metallicities but also shows characteristics of standard GCs, such as hosting multiple stellar populations.

Although one of a growing number of such systems, Terzan 5 has uniquely been shown to have a similar α-Fe plane distribution to that of the bulge.  The distribution of a system's stellar populations in this plane is a useful diagnostic of its star formation history.  Such a correlation indicates a similarity in the chemical evolution of the systems, where a decline in the [α/Fe] abundance ratio from the α-enhanced, SN II-enriched, plateau has historically been attributed to the onset of Type Ia SNe.  The similarity between Terzan 5 and the bulge in this plane has thus been suggested to be indicative of a high mass for the progenitor of Terzan 5, which would in turn suggest that this system was an important contributor to the stellar mass content of the Galactic bulge.  Therefore, it has been proposed that the cluster is the surviving remnant of a primordial building block of the Milky Way bulge.

## Comparing stellar chemistry

We compare the abundances of 10 elements in Terzan 5 stars with those of their bulge field counterparts, finding that they differ at statistically significant levels.  From this, we could conclude that Terzan 5 is not the remnant of a major building block of the bulge.
