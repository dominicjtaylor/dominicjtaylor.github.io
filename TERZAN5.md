# Terzan 5
It has been proposed that the globular cluster-like system Terzan 5 is the surviving remnant of a primordial building block of the Milky Way bulge, mainly due to the age/metallicity spread and the distribution of its stars in the Î±-Fe plane. We compare the abundances of 10 elements in Terzan 5 stars with those of their bulge field counterparts, finding that they differ at statistically significant levels. From this, we could conclude that Terzan 5 is not the remnant of a major building block of the bulge.
