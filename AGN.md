# Changing-Look AGN
Changing-Look AGN (CLAGN) are active galactic nuclei that appear to transition between types defined by characteristics of their optical spectra. The causes, involved time-scales, and the frequency at which these changes happen are still not well understood. So far, systematic searches of CLAGN have used optical criteria (photometric or spectral changes) to select objects, with only < 100 CLAGN being currently known. In this project, we select CLAGN by large X-ray flux changes and find ~ 70 new CLAGN.
