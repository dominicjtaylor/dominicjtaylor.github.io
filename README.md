Here are my projects to date. You can click their titles for more information!

### [Changing-Look AGN](AGN.md)
Changing-Look AGN (CLAGN) are active galactic nuclei that appear to transition between types defined by characteristics of their optical spectra.  The causes, involved time-scales, and the frequency at which these changes happen are still not well understood.  So far, systematic searches of CLAGN have used optical criteria (photometric or spectral changes) to select objects, with only < 100 CLAGN being currently known.  In this project, we select CLAGN by large X-ray flux changes and find ~ 70 new CLAGN.

### [Terzan 5](TERZAN5.md)
It has been proposed that the globular cluster-like system Terzan 5 is the surviving remnant of a primordial building block of the Milky Way bulge, mainly due to the age/metallicity spread and the distribution of its stars in the $\alpha$-Fe plane.  We compare the abundances of 10 elements in Terzan 5 stars with those of their bulge field counterparts, finding that they differ at statistically significant levels.  From this, we could conclude that Terzan 5 is not the remnant of a *major* building block of the bulge.
