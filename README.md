### [Changing-Look AGN](AGN.md)
Changing-Look AGN (CLAGN) are active galactic nuclei that appear to transition between types.

In this project, we found ~ 70 new CLAGN by searching for large X-ray flux changes, and investigate the involved time-scales and the frequency at which these changes happen.

### [Terzan 5](TERZAN5.md)
It has been proposed that the globular cluster-like system Terzan 5 is the surviving remnant of a primordial building block of the Milky Way bulge, mainly due to the age/metallicity spread and the distribution of its stars in the Î±-Fe plane.

We compare the abundances of 10 elements in Terzan 5 stars with those of their bulge field counterparts, finding that they differ at statistically significant levels.  From this, we could conclude that Terzan 5 is not the remnant of a *major* building block of the bulge.

### [EAGLE](EAGLE.md)
Galaxies grow via hierarchical merging.  The stellar mass - halo mass relation tells us that more massive haloes of dark matter host more massive galaxies, but this relation exhibits significant scatter.

Using the EAGLE cosmological simulations, I investigated the second order influences on the efficiency of galaxy formation by exploring what physical processes correlate with stellar mass at fixed halo mass.
